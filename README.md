Integrating Angular 2 and GWT 2.8

This library allows you to write your front-end application in Java 8 and Angular 2, through the use of the GWT compiler.

Best for you is to go to the website http://lteconsulting.fr/angular2boot/ !

You can also get demo code from those repositories :
- https://github.com/ltearno/angular2boot-demos with basic use cases demonstrated
- https://github.com/ltearno/tour-of-heroes which mimics the official Angular 2 (Typescript) tutorial.
